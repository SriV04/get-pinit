 Hey,
We really appreciate you signing up to be one of our first users! We’re Shlok and Sri, and we’ve been building Pinit for almost a year now, and are so excited that its almost ready
Neither of us grew up in London, we only moved here for uni, and one thing we loved was just how many incredible restaurants there are. But it quickly got overwhelming to keep track: we would save TikToks and Instagram posts everywhere, half remember recommendations from friends, and then end up in Nandos far too often when we couldn't make a decision. That frustration is exactly what became Pinit and we can’t wait to share this with you guys
We can't wait to share this with you guys, so you never have to settle on a restaurant again. No more "where should we eat?" spirals. No more struggling to find a compromise with your friend group. Just great spots from people you actually trust, right when you need them.
We know you're buzzing for it to come out, so in the meantime, we thought we'd share a few of our personal favourites across London. Consider this your first taste of what Pinit is all about, real recommendations. Give them a try while you sit tight. 
Bubala
A 100% vegetarian restaurant with seriously bold flavours that makes die-hard meat eaters forget about meat. Our personal favourite was the smacked cucumbers - Sri
Crunch:
A cult-favourite sandwich spot in Spitalfields with the fluffiest bread  I have had. The top shout is the chicken katsu, and don't skip the 1000-layer potatoes with Bloody Mary ketchup. - Shlok
Reun Thai:
A cosy, family-run Thai spot in Hammersmith that's truly a hidden gem. Authentic, affordable food with consistently brilliant service. - Sri
Ambassadors Clubhouse:
Lavish Indian restaurant from the team behind Gymkhana. With prawns the size of your fist, and  cocktails as theatrical as the décor, it's the perfect place for a special evening. - Shlok
