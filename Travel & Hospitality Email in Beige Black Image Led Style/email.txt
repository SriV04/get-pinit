 Hey,
We really appreciate you signing up to be one of our first customers! We have been building Pinit for almost a year and are really happy that it is almost ready and can’t wait for you to never have to settle on a restaurant again!
I know you are buzzing for it to come out and cant wait for the recommendations that it provides so in the meantime here are a few of our favourites across London for you to try while you sit tight.
Shlok and Sriharsha

Ambassadors Clubhouse
One of the best Indian’s Shlok has had in London. Delicious biryani, Prawns the size of your first and unique cocktails 
Crunch
A sandwich place Sri loves, Juicy burgers, fresh bread and very vegetarian friendly
Reun Thai, Hammermsith
A true hidden gem in hammermsith. Authentic thai food at affordable prices and friendly servers and even lunch time offers. Not much more to ask for!

Copita, Soho:
A Spanish tapas place on the wishlist for both of us. So someone give it a try and let us know how it is
